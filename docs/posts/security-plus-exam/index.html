Today, I’m excited to share my journey and experiences with the CompTIA Security+ exam. I’ll take you through the steps I took to prepare and provide insights into the exam itself.</p><p>As a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, I’ve long understood the significance of the Security+ certification in today’s job market. I’ve delved into educational videos, listened to podcasts, and absorbed valuable knowledge along the way. This certification not only signifies your foundational understanding of cybersecurity but is also often a requirement in job descriptions, alongside certifications like CEH. So, I decided to embark on my journey to achieve the Security+ certification.” 🚀😎</p><p>As a master’s degree student in the UK, I lucked out with a sweet deal on my Security+ (Sec+) certification voucher. While the standard price for the certification is £233, I discovered an academic CompTIA website offering the same voucher for just £136. After factoring in the VAT, the total cost came to £150. Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled! 😄👍</p><p><a href="https://uk-academic-store.comptia.org/certification-vouchers/c/11331?facetValueFilter=tenant%7Euser-type%3Aindividual" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Certification Vouchers — CompTIA Marketplace Academic U.K.</a></p><p>you can check your country as well, if it possible.</p><h2 id=pre-exam>Pre-Exam

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>To get started, your first step is to download the exam objectives. This document will give you a clear roadmap of the topics covered in the Sec+ 601 exam. It’s like your treasure map in this journey!</p><p>Once you have the objectives in front of you, take a closer look. You’ll notice that it breaks down the exam content into different modules. What’s even cooler is that it tells you the weightage of each module. This helps you figure out which areas are the heavy hitters, so you can focus your study efforts wisely. It’s like having a secret weapon for acing the exam! 😉📚🎯</p><p><a href=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/comptia-securitysy0601examobjectives20/250426517 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Comptia security-sy0–601-exam-objectives-(2–0)</a></p><p>After securing my voucher, the next big question was: where do I start preparing for the Sec+ exam? I scoured YouTube for all sorts of free courses, hoping to find something engaging and informative. To be honest, I wasn’t quite thrilled with most of what I found.</p><p>But then, I stumbled upon Professor Messer’s course, and it was a game-changer! 🎮📚 I watched all his videos, took diligent notes, and it really helped me grasp the essentials.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NE33fpQuw8?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><p>Yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to go even deeper. So, I got my hands on the official CompTIA Security+ book. It’s a paid resource, available for purchase or through your local library. Since I’m a resourceful student, I found it on the internet. I’ve attached an image for your reference. 📖🔍</p><p>Reading books on cybersecurity might sound boring to some, but let me tell you, it can be a game-changer. When I started with the first chapter of that CompTIA Security+ book, I was hooked. 📖❤️ Each chapter was like a thrilling adventure, and it just kept getting better.</p><p>What I loved was that after every chapter, there were 20 mock questions. These were gold because they really helped reinforce what I’d learned. I’d read a chapter, take the test, and then go through the answers. If I got any wrong, I’d make sure to understand the concept better. It was like my own personal journey of discovery.</p><p>To add some spice to my study routine, I also watched videos on practice tests for the Security+ exam. It was like the final piece of the puzzle, helping me fine-tune my knowledge and get ready to conquer that certification! 🚀📺🧠</p><p>Here is the links of vidoes which I have watched.</p><p>Taking the Security+ Practice Test

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>If you’ve already earned a certification like this, you’re likely familiar with the Pearson VUE experience. However, if it’s your first time, you might have loads of questions about what to expect, how the process works, and what it all looks like. So, don’t worry — you’re not alone in wondering about this.</p><p>Choosing between online and offline options for your exam is a critical decision. If you’ve opted for the online version, it’s essential to ensure that you’re in a quiet, distraction-free environment with a clean desk. Once you’ve booked your online exam, keep an eye on your email for further instructions.</p><p>Following the booking, you’ll receive an email, and it’s crucial to read it carefully. It will contain valuable information and guidelines regarding your online exam.</p><p>One critical step is to test your environment. You’ll need to download an application from the website, and the email will outline the specific steps you should follow. Make sure to go through these steps in advance to ensure a smooth and trouble-free exam experience.</p><p>It’s a great practice for me to thoroughly check all the components before the exam day, including my microphone, video, camera, and internet connection. If everything checks out and is working smoothly, I should stick with the same setup on my actual exam day.</p><p>In my case, giving the exam in my university library was an excellent choice. It’s typically a quiet and exam-friendly environment, which is crucial for concentration during the test.</p><p>Starting the application 15 minutes early, as per the exam policy, is a wise move. It gives me ample time to address any last-minute issues or concerns and ensures a stress-free experience when my exam officially begins. Good on me for being well-prepared! 📚👍</p><p>After starting the application, they verified my documents using my mobile camera. The proctor then came on, guiding me through the initial steps. The proctor also performed a thorough check of my desk environment, ensuring that there were no prohibited items around. It’s essential to note that headphones are not allowed during the exam.</p><p>Once these initial checks were successfully completed, I was taken to the exam itself. It’s worth noting that you can’t access any other part of your system during the exam; it’s a dedicated exam environment to ensure a fair and secure testing experience. 📝🖥️🔒</p><p>In the Sec+ exam, I encountered 79 multiple-choice format question, and there were occasional questions where I had to select more than one option. Most of the questions were scenario-based, requiring me to think critically before providing an answer.</p><p>It’s important to note that very few questions were straightforward. In my case, I came across a few practical questions that were based on network topology, and I had to select dynamic answers.</p><p>A strategic approach was key. I began by tackling the simple, one-liner, and straightforward questions. Then, I worked on the scenario-based questions. If I ever found myself torn between two answers for a question, I wisely chose to leave it for later and moved on to questions where I was more confident.</p><p>An essential tip is to mark questions for review after I select my answer. This ensures they are considered for evaluation. It’s a crucial step to not forget. After going through every question, reviewing the marked ones helped me keep track of what was left to address. This approach can be a game-changer in managing my time effectively during the exam. 🕐📝👍</p><p>Once I finished the exam, I was prompted with some personal, non-exam-related questions that were merely for informational purposes. They included basic details like name, gender, and nationality.</p><p>Upon completing this phase, if your score is above 750, you’ll receive a message congratulating you on passing the exam. For the certification itself, you’ll need to wait for a day.</p><p>You’ll receive an email from CompTIA, and in it, you’ll find your Security+ badge and certification. It’s a fantastic feeling!</p><h2 id=key-takeaways>Key Takeaways
