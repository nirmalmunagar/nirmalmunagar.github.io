```bash
git clone https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/seeker.git
cd seeker/
apt update
apt install python3 python3-pip php
pip3 install requests
```

## Step 2: Setup ngrok for Server

Now we need to setup ngrok for the server. Go to [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up.

After signing up, you'll get this page where you can download ngrok according to your operating system:
