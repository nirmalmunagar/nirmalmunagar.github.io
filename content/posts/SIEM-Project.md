🔒 **Excited to Share My Master's Degree Project**: Building a Security Operations Center with Open-Source SIEM Tools! 🔍

I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my master's degree project, where I designed and implemented a cutting-edge Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source SIEM tools like the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack and GNS3. This project was a culmination of my passion for cybersecurity and my commitment to enhancing network security for organizations.

## Task 1: Detecting and Preventing DOS Attacks Using FortiGate Firewall 🔥

In the first part of my project, I focused on safeguarding the company's network from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. I deployed the FortiGate firewall, a robust and industry-leading security solution, to defend against such malicious attacks. The FortiGate firewall effectively detected and prevented any potential DoS attacks, ensuring that the company's network remained resilient and reliable at all times.



## Task 2: Preventing Malware Attacks and Analyzing Events with SIEM 🛡️

The second phase of my project involved implementing a comprehensive defense against malware attacks within the company’s network. Leveraging the power of the open-source SIEM tool, I successfully thwarted potential malware threats and orchestrated an efficient event analysis mechanism. This enabled real-time monitoring, rapid detection, and timely response to any suspicious activities, ensuring the company’s critical assets and sensitive data remained secure.

## Task 3: Detecting Directory Traversal Attacks on the Company Web Server 🕸️

In the final part of my project, I set my sights on securing the company’s web server from directory traversal attacks, a common web application vulnerability. Utilizing the SIEM tool, I implemented robust rules and alerting mechanisms, enabling prompt detection of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability. By taking preventive measures against directory traversal attacks, I ensured that the company’s web server remained resilient against potential threats.

## 🎓 My Key Takeaways and the Future of Cybersecurity 🚀

During this project, I not only gained invaluable technical skills in deploying and managing open-source SIEM tools but also developed a profound understanding of the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. The project’s success further solidified my belief in the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new threats.

As I embark on the next phase of my journey, I am enthusiastic about contributing my expertise to the cybersecurity industry and helping organizations strengthen their defense against cyber threats. My aim is to make a positive impact in the field of cybersecurity, and I am actively seeking opportunities to work with forward-thinking teams that prioritize proactive security measures.

A big thank you to my supportive mentors, esteemed professors, and all those who contributed to the success of this project. I am immensely proud of what I have accomplished, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the world of cybersecurity!
