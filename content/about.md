As a cybersecurity graduate with a master's degree in computer forensics and cybersecurity from the University of Greenwich, I have developed technical expertise in web application security testing, firewall management, cloud virtualization, and server administration. I also acquired multiple certifications in ethical hacking, Python programming, and Cisco networking, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and skill enhancement.

I have gained hands-on experience in implementing and working with various network and infrastructure monitoring tools, such as Zabbix, Graphana, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch, as a security analyst at CyberTalos. I have also successfully applied my knowledge of AWS services, such as WAF, CloudWatch, SQS, Lambda, and S3, to create and secure cloud-based applications as a cloud security associate at Virtually Testing Foundation. With my passion for cybersecurity and a collaborative mindset, my aim to secure a challenging role as a cybersecurity professional, where I can contribute to the development of effective security solutions and advance my career goals.
